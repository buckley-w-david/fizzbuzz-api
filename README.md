# FizzBuzz API

A revolutionary step forward in computing.

No longer shall we be forced to slave away in the code mines, breaking our backs cranking out FizzBuzz implementations to satisfy our FAANG overlords.

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen

for i in range(0, 100):
    req = urlopen(f'https://fizzbuzz.ca/{i}')
    print(req.read().decode())
```
